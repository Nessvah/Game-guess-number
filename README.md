## Overview

- Made the game with the mobile first approach and made it responsive to other screen sizes. It would benefit with some more optimizations on that area.
- I learned a lot about DOM and understood better how to manipulate it with JS. It looked a lit bit overwhelming at first but after you get the hang of it, it's really simple.
- Tried to DRY code. For that, instead of writing everytime all the code that was equal, I created functions for that particular action and made First-class functions (functions who call other functions).

## Credits

This game was created giving the example of [Jonas Schmedtamnn](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) on his course of Javascript. I followed the basic style but did everything from scratch without relying on his videos with the solution/explanation.

It was really fun doing it and I hope my daughter will enjoy testing the game.
